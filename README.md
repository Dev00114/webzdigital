The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP for short) is a powerful JavaScript library that enables front-end developers and designers to create robust timeline based animations. This allows for precise control for more involved animation sequences rather than the sometimes constraining keyframe and animation properties that CSS offers.

The best part about this library is that it’s lightweight and easy to use.

With GSAP, you can start creating engaging animations with little to no knowledge of JavaScript.

This guide will show how to set up and use GSAP’s TweenMax feature and also dive into a bit of Club GreenSock’s DrawSVG plugin. Each of the examples below has a corresponding CodePen link so you can follow along in another tab.
